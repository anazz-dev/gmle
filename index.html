  <div class="Introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This book is supposed to help you prepare for the German Medical License Examination (GMLE) test. The GMLE test is referred to in German as: die Kenntnisprüfung. The GMLE is the examination you must pass in order to be allowed to practice
      medicine in Germany. The literal translation of “die Kenntnisprüfung” from German to English is the knowledge exam. I suggest the term (GMLE) to have the vocabulary comparable to other international medical examinations such as the United
      States Medical License Examination (USMLE).</p>
    <p>My goal is to provide you with information about the GMLE test in English. The GMLE test resources are mostly in German. This makes it hard for non-German speakers to make an informed decision before start investing time and money learning the
      German language. This lack of English resources, motivated me to write this book. if you are an international medical graduate, interested in a medical residency in Germany, with the help of this book you will be able to define your goal, learn
      more about the details of the GMLE test, find answers to frequently asked questions, and manage to prepare a detailed study plan for the test preparation.</p>

  <div class="chapter1">
    <h2>Define Your Goal</h2>
    <p>It is extremely important for your career success to define a clear goal. To help you make an informed decision about a medical residency in Germany, I want to touch on one of the most important question you need to ask yourself:</p>
    <h4>Is Germany the right choice for my medical residency? </h4>
    <p>Finding your dream medical residency in Germany is possible. One of the most attractive points in doing a medical residency in Germany is the possibility to find a training position in your most desired medical field. It is possible to find a
      residency in competitive subspecialties. In comparison, it might be hard to do so in the United States of America or England.</p>
    <p>The language issue. As an international medical graduate (IMG), probably, you studied medicine in English. Therefore, English-speaking countries can be attractive to continue your medical training in. If you decide on going to an
      English-speaking country, you can focus on becoming a better physician. On the other hand, in Germany even if your medical knowledge is great, your competency will largely be judged based on your language abilities. Therefore, you will have to
      focus on your medical training and on making your language better. Double the trouble!</p>
    <p>The medical residency training in Germany is chaotic sometimes. In German hospitals the residency program concept is uncommon. Instead, you have a logbook that you need to fill during your residency and submit directly to the medical council.
      Thus, the quality of training depends largely on your personal efforts, the hospital you will be working at, the team you will be working with, and on your relationship with your supervisors. University rankings for 2019 show that the top
      German university the Technische Universität München (TUM) ranks at 61st among universities of the world (4). On the other hand, from the top ten universities from all over the world, five universities are from the United States of America (4).
      That being said, securing a medical residency training position at one of the university hospitals in Germany can be hard. Which means you could end up doing your residency at a hospital that doesn’t have any ranking without any residency
      program.</p>
    <p>Financially, well compensated during the residency years. During your residency years you are financially well compensated. The salary of first year medical resident in 2019 is on average 4400 euros before taxation (6). This increases en route
      toward the end of the residency and with night shifts. Compared to living expenses in Germany it is more than enough. You will have thirty days as paid holidays too. In this aspect a medical residency in Germany beats other medical residencies
      in other countries. However, there is a drawback! after you finish your residency, the salary remains largely unchanged. That is the reason why many German medical doctors tend to leave Germany after they finish their residency. </p>
    <p>Reach a decision soon and stick to it. I hope the previous points help you make an informed decision about a medical residency in Germany. There is a misconception that the medical residency path in Germany is easier or cheaper than other
      countries. In reality, the medical residency in Germany will take time, effort and financial resources. The GMLE test is the most straightforward way towards a medical residency in Germany. The sooner you start your preparation journey the
      better. Regulations in Germany could change fast. There are many plans to address the shortage of medical doctors in Germany. Those remain as propositions and I do not see them becoming reality anytime soon, but who knows!</p>

    <h2>German Medical Exam - The Basics</h2>
    <p>If you are an international medical graduate (IMG) with medical training in a country outside of the European Union, the European Economic Area or in Switzerland, to be able to start your medical residency in Germany the most straightforward
      way is to pass the GMLE test. </p>
    <h4>How is the test structured?</h4>
    <p>The GMLE test consists of a patient case (clinical skills) and a 60 to 90 minutes oral examination. The test covers both surgery and internal medicine. The questions during the oral examination take into account aspects from the both fields
      such as imaging procedures, clinical pharmacology/pharmacotherapy, emergency medicine and radiation protection, as well as legal questions relating to the practice of medicine. The GMLE test is successfully completed when the examination
      committee has assessed the clinical skills and the oral examination as sufficient (1). </p>
    <h4>How much does the test cost?</h4>
    <p>The cost of the test ranges from 266 euros to 1100 euros depending on the state (6).</p>
    <h4>How can I register to take the test?</h4>
    <p>To register to take the test you will need to send in a filled application with all required documents to a medical council in one of the German states. Germany has sixteen different states. Each state has its own medical council. A list of
      medical councils and their addresses is included in the useful links chapter. All documents need to be properly translated to German and authenticated from local authorities and the German embassy in your home country. </p>
    <h4>When is the best time to register?</h4>
    <p>I recommend you send your papers as soon as they are ready. If you follow the strategy I propose in this book, ideally you will be in your first week of the Hospitation (clinical observership in a German hospital) when you send in your papers.
      It will take a minimum duration of six months to get your test appointment after you send your papers to a medical council. </p>
    <h4>Can I reschedule the GMLE test?</h4>
    <p>You can request rescheduling of the exam by contacting the test organizing committee in your designated medical council. Usually, your new appointment will be within three months from the first assigned date. I do not recommend multiple
      rescheduling as it is important for successful test preparation to stick to an appointment. However, I recommend postponing it one time if the date for the test happens to be too soon.</p>
    <h4>Where does the GMLE test take place?</h4>
    <p>Starting from 2018 in Lower Saxony, for example, the tests are held at the medical council. In fact, I passed my test in Hannover in 2018, and it was the first test committee to be held at the medical council in Lower Saxony. However, it is
      still possible that you will have your test at one of the academic hospitals in the state where you applied. A week before of the test you will receive the exact location of your test.</p>
    <h4>Can I relocate my application to another German state?</h4>
    <p>It is possible to relocate your application to another German state. However, I discourage you from doing so. To relocate your application, it might take as long as three months. Sometimes, applications are lost and it is hard to track them.
    </p>
    <h4>Who is on the examination committee?</h4>
    <p>The examination committee consists of three specialists. One specialist in internal medicine, another surgery specialist, and one generalist. </p>
    <h4>What is the clinical skills part of the test?</h4>
    <p>This is an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) style test. In your application you will have to mention your specialty of interest. The clinical case most probably relates to your specialty of interest. For example, your specialty
      of interest is neurology you might get a case of headache. One examiner will be supervising the session. You will have to take a detailed yet relevant medical history from the patient. After taking the history you need to perform clinical
      examination related to the case. The examiner might ask you to perform specific clinical examinations and can ask you to show specific clinical findings. Afterwards, you will have 20 minutes of time to write down your findings. During the
      clinical skills part of the test you will be provided with a medical dictionary. </p>
    <h4>What is the oral examination part of the test? </h4>
    <p>The oral examination duration is 60 to 90 minutes. It is usual that you will have other examinees tested with you. Usually three participants in total including you. However, the duration of the oral examination is 60 to 90 minutes each. This
      means you will be setting there for around three hours. You and the other participants will be asked to present your cases. Each participant will have fifteen minutes to present his/her case. After the cases presentation there is a short break.
      After this short break, you will be asked questions from each specialist in their field of specialty. The more you know the more detailed the questions get. That is a sign you are doing great. </p>
    <h4>How is the GMLE test graded?</h4>
    <p>If your clinical case presentation and your oral examination answers fulfilled the desired requirements, you will pass the exam. I think it is important to do nail the clinical skills part, as this is the part where you can guide the
      interaction with the patient and impress the examiner. </p>
    <h4>What is the percentage of IMGs passing the GMLE test?</h4>
    <p>According to the German Medical Association 2016, most foreign doctors came from Romania (4285), Greece (3118) and Syria (2895), followed by Austria (2600). The failure rate in the compulsory specialized medical language test and the GMLE test
      was more than 50 percent in the first attempt (3). </p>
    <h4>How long will I have to wait till I know my score?</h4>
    <p>Examiners will inform you directly after the test if you pass or fail. You will get a written confirmation in 2 weeks after the test. </p>
    <h4>What if I fail the GMLE test? </h4>
    <p>Authorities describe that participation in the knowledge test (GMLE) is only possible a total of 2 times (Berlin 3 times).
      However, some resources suggest that there is no limit for how many times you could try to pass the test (2).
      For optimal test preparation I recommend to consider that the maximum number of trials is 3 times in total. However, if you fail more than that, maybe it is time to get yourself a lawyer.
    </p>
    <h4>Could my medical degree be equivalent to the German medical degree without the test?</h4>
    <p>There seems to be a possibility to circumvent the test. The authorities can check if your medical degree is equivalent to the medical curriculum taught in German medical schools (2). However, practically this process is highly variable and
      subjective. In my opinion, If you try it you will waste your time and money. If you want to try this route, you will need the assistance of a lawyer.</p>
    <h4>Do I need a specialized language exam? </h4>
    <p>For physicians graduating from non-German speaking countries, in order to be allowed to register for the GMLE, they need to prove knowledge of the German language required for the practice of medicine. This proof must be provided in a
      specialist language examination (Fachsprachpruefung). The examination (language level C1) consists of a simulated doctor-patient interview (duration: 20 minutes), the documentation of this interview (20 minutes) and a doctor-doctor interview
      (20 minutes). The specialist language examination is successfully completed when the assessment committee has determined that the applicant fulfills the requirements. The focus here is the medical language and not the medical knowledge. The
      costs of this specialized language are 350 Euro on average (6). If you have your C1 German language level this exam should not be a problem for you. If you fail in it you can retake it for an unlimited number of times or until you pass it. That
      is why I do not go into its details.

    <h2>Time and Study Plan</h2>
    <p> So, now you made up your mind. You defined your goal and you want to pursue a medical residency in Germany. Great! Now it is time to make a schedule for your test preparation journey.</p>
    <h3>Years prior:</h3>
    <p>
      Define your goal. Educate yourself about the situation in Germany. Reread the "Define your goal" chapter if needed. It is paramount that you have a clear goal in mind and to stick to it. After you define your goal, register in a German language
      course. The sooner you start learning German the better. The choice of school is largely based on your financial situation and logistics. Officially, the required certificate is the B2 language certificate. However, it is even better to have a
      C1 certificate. Your language abilities will determine a huge part of your success in Germany. It will make your residency years easier. Remember, in Germany, your competency will always be judged based on your language skills. Sometimes you
      might feel that your language skills are more important than your medical knowledge. Make sure you have the best foundation you can in the language. Do not rush it. If you study intensively, give yourself 12-24 months before you set for the C1
      language test. Trust me it will make a big difference.
    </p>
    <h3>Months prior:</h3>
    <p>
      By now you have your C1 certificate. Twelve Months prior to your desired test date, you will need to get in contact with the German embassy at your home country. Ask the embassy which documents are needed in order to work as a physician in
      Germany. Translate the needed papers and authenticate them as described by the German authorities. Decide which German state you want to submit your papers to. Start applying for a Hospitation in the state of your choice. The Hospitation is an
      observership. Optimally try to get a Hospitation in your desired field of work. Example, if you are interested in neurosurgery then do your Hospitation in a surgical department. Contact academic hospitals to maximize your chance of getting a
      Hospitation. In the useful links chapter you will find a link to academic hospitals. I recommend contacting academic hospitals in rural areas to maximize your chance of getting accepted. Once you have your Hospitation invitation from a hospital
      and your C1 certificate, apply for a visa to travel to Germany. when you are in Germany and during your first week of Hospitation, send your papers to the medical council in the state you are living in. It will take around eight weeks to get a
      notification of receiving your papers. Usually you will receive a date for the specialized language test three months after submitting your papers. Once you pass the specialized language test, it usually takes a minimum duration of six months
      to get your first GMLE test appointment. After passing your specialized German language test, under certain conditions and in some states, you are allowed to work in Germany with a restricted work permit. The aim of this restricted work permit
      is to provide hands on clinical experience to prepare for the GMLE test. You will be notified about the GMLE test date eight weeks ahead of your test date, sometimes even less. To be able to prepare for the test, my recommendation is to delay
      the first test appointment.
    </p>
    <h3>Weeks prior:</h3>
    <p>
      Now you know the exact date of your test. I recommend that you dedicate a minimum of eight weeks for the preparation of the GMLE test. No matter what duration you choose to prepare for your test, you should have a study plan for that duration.
      If you were working with a limited work permit, then inform the head of the department to plan accordingly. Take the needed duration as time off from work. You will need nine hours of focused study daily. I passed my test and I would like to
      share with you my study plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read the Fallbuch internal medicine book, and the Fallbuch surgery book once from cover to cover and highlight. Those books are simple, straight to the point. The test is largely similar to those books. Each book takes around ten days to read
      if you dedicate nine hours of studying. Know your weaknesses and rectify them. After your first read, check previous test experiences. I provide a link to a website in German collecting previous test experiences in the useful links chapter.
      Dedicate four days for previous examinations. Write down topics that are repeated. Estimate your strength in each topic. Usually medical students are trained on multiple choice questions. Therefore, oral examinations need a specific strategy
      for answering. Try to visualize the examination committee asking you the questions and make a mental road map of your answers regarding each topic. Reread. Now you know which topics are high yield. You have already read the top-rated books once
      and highlighted the important concepts. Now reread. Focus on high yield topics. Plan five days for each book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Register to AMBOSS. Once you finish your second reading, register to AMBOSS. It is a website dedicated for medical students in Germany to help them prepare for their medical exams. There is a section dedicated for the final oral medical exam.
      The GMLE for IMGs is inspired by this exam. AMBOSS offers a section of twenty-one days of study plan to prepare for the oral examination. However, the topics covered in AMBOSS’s twenty-one days study plan are more than those required for the
      GMLE. It will take you two weeks to cover the relevant material in AMBOSS. In AMBOSS you will find high quality clinical examination videos, which are valuable for the clinical skills part of the GMLE test. Revise. If you follow my proposed
      plan you will have two weeks for revision before your test date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay healthy. Remember during this time to stay healthy, eat healthy, get enough sleep, and workout. However, feel free to plan your study period the way works out for you best. Some students benefit from using flash cards, tables, and
      summaries.
    </p>
    <h3>One week prior:</h3>
    <p>
      Make sure you know where your exam is. Sometimes you will receive a letter with the names of your examiners. You can check their field of interest. However, this uncommon lately. Plan your trip. Book your train, and if possible visit the
      location of the test. Make sure you have your ID and required papers ready. Know what to wear for the examination and have your clothes ready. You will need a lab coat too. Semi-formal dress code is advisable. Call test organizing committee and
      confirm the test date and location. Based on your trip arrangements start by waking up accordingly (example. If your test is at 10:00 am and you live 2 hours away by train, you might want to take the train that leaves at 6:00 am to make sure
      you get there on time, trains sometime are not on time even in Germany). So, if your travel is like the aforementioned example, during the week prior to the test you need to start by waking up at 5:00 am daily. If you need to travel more than 2
      hours by train on your test day, I recommend to get a hotel close by to the test center. Again, make sure you stay healthy and get enough sleep.
    </p>
    <h3>One day prior:</h3>
    <p>Chill. Relax. Keep your routine. During the day revise clinical skills and your short notes of high yield topics. Try to get a good night sleep.</p>
    <h3>Test day</h3>
    <p>
      On the exam day, wake up at your regular time from the week before. Eat your breakfast. Make sure your ID and needed papers are ready. Arrive 30 minutes before the time of the test. Remember, It is ok to feel nervous, just do not panic. Smile
      and be friendly, you are almost there. Good luck!

    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      I hope you are now informed about the option of a medical residency in Germany. I would like to share with you some general thoughts that helped me along the way. Remember, always educate yourself. Once you finish your medical school training
      it is just the beginning. Things will get rough. Remember your well-defined goal and stick to it. Stay objective and believe in yourself. You can do it all by yourself. I passed the specialized medical language test and the GMLE test without
      enrolling in any dedicated school. Many other international medical graduates did the same. They depended on themselves. If we did it you can do it too. Be careful of schools, individuals, or websites promising you an easy way out. There is
      simply no easy way out. You will have to put in the hours and the hard work. Just grind your way through! Take your time. Do not rush things. Your criteria should be your progress. As long you are making daily progress towards your goal you are
      on the right track. Create your own support group and cherish them. Surround yourself with like-minded people. If you know some of your colleagues with the same goal of finding a medical residency in Germany talk to them, meet together, and
      discuss. Stay in touch with your supportive friends and family. Get in contact with people who managed to pass the test already, and ask them to be your mentors. I am sure many will be more than happy to help you. Finally, I wish you the best.
      I look forward to hearing your success stories. It would be my honor if I managed to help even a little bit by writing this book.
